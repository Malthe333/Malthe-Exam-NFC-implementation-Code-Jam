How to run the software:
It can be done by accessing the Package Manager in the Window tab in Unity Editor and pressing the + icon to add a Package. Some packages can be added with search of a name, others with url.

3 different Packages needs to be installed:


1. Vector Graphics. This was implemented to make the svg files from Figma be imported to Unity correctly. Figma was the main program used for the design.
2. Input Manager. A mandatory implementation, yet this is the one that’s used for transforming the inputs of a fingers touch to a left click, thereby making the application and buttons interactable.
3. Device Simulator. Used as a practical tool to help develop an app, as this can simulate Auto rotations, touch input, screen safe area blabla. This was a convinient tool for having the Unity Editor more in sync with what the build project would look like.
